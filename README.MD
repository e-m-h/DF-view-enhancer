# Daggerfall View Enhancer
This is a script to enhance the in-game Daggerfall view distance beyond what is permitted in-game, similar to Eye of Argonia. The primary differences between this tool and Eye of Argonia is that DVE is cross-platform and supports more than one value, where EoA is Windows-only and will only set the maximum viewing distance value.

To use, make sure the "SAVETREE.DAT" file for the saved game to be modified is in the same directory as DVE. As of right now, DVE does not modify the original and will output to a new file called "newsavetree". Replace the original "SAVETREE.DAT" with "newsavetree" (making the necessary filename changes yourself).

DVE is a learning experience and still very much a work-in-progress.
